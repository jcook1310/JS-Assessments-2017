#### 4. What is Bootstrap? Explain a few reasons that you might choose to use it in a project?


 //Your Answer: Bootstrap is a website that offers already coded elements that you can incorporate into your own code. It is helpful for when you know you need something fast since the code is already written. It is also useful to add more visually appealing features to the page.


 //Googled Answer:Bootstrap is a free front-end framework for faster and easier web development
Bootstrap includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels and many other, as well as optional JavaScript plugins
Bootstrap also gives you the ability to easily create responsive designs



#### 5. Name 4 semantic html tags. <header></header>, <div></div>, <p></p>, <h1></h1>,<footer></footer>

#### 6. What is block scope that became available in ES6? Include how it differs from local and global scope, and what variables are block scoped.

 //Your Answer: Block scope is similar to local scope but uses the let and const variables to assign its value. It limits those elements to the scope.


 //Googled Answer:While there are many issues that trip up developers coming from other languages, variable scoping may be number one. The fundamental problem is that many expect variables to be scoped to a particular block (like a for loop), but in JavaScript variables declared with var are scoped to the nearest parent function.

 #### 7. What is front end development? Can you identify any tools/skills that are uniquely required of front end developers?

 //Your Answer: front end is what is seen on the web page. CSS and HTML is what is used to style how the page looks.

//line 71 is using the class concept that gives App its own properties but uses properties from Component//
class App extends Component{
    //now inside the class i would be give a value a state at that time on the webpage//
    constructor (props){
        super(props){
            this.state
        }
    }
}

 #### 9. What is the difference between a div and a span?


 //Your Answer: a div is an html element that has other elements nested inside.


 //Googled Answer: The <div> tag is nothing more than a container unit that encapsulates other page elements and divides the HTML document into sections.
 The <span> tag is used to group inline-elements in a document.



#### 10. How would you explain the idea of "inheritance" in object oriented programming?


 //Your Answer: inheritance is a class or object that has its own properties but it also inherits properties from the parent object.

 //Googled Answer:In object-oriented programming, inheritance enables new objects to take on the properties of existing objects.
